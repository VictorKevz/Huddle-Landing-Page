## Overview



### Links
Challenge Page: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-alternating-feature-blocks-5ca5f5981e82137ec91a5100
## Built With
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web development.
- **CSS3**: For styling the components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** and **npm** should be installed on your machine.
- **Git** should be installed for cloning the repository.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.
2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Change your current directory to the project folder.
3. **Install dependencies**: Run the command to install all necessary dependencies.
4. **Start the development server**: Run the command to start the development server and view the project in your browser.

## Usage
Once the development server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the landing page and interact with it.

## Components
The project is divided into several main components:
- **Home**: This is the main hero section.
- **Features**: This section showcases the different features.
- **CTA (Call to Action)**: This section encourages users to take action and overlaps other sections.
- **Footer**: This is the footer section of the page.

Each component has its own CSS file to keep the styles organized and scoped to the component.

## Styling
The project uses a combination of a global CSS file and component-specific CSS files:
- **Global CSS**: Contains general styles, responsive design rules, and active states.
- **Component-specific CSS**: Each component has its own CSS file to handle its unique styles.

The global CSS includes variables for colors, font settings, and base styles for elements like headings and paragraphs. Media queries are used to ensure the layout is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes.
